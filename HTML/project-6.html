                <h2 style="color:brown;">PIZZA:-</h2>
               <b>pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot.<br>

                 One of the simplest and most traditional pizzas is the Margherita, which is topped with tomatoes or tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil. Popular legend relates that it was named for Queen Margherita, wife of Umberto I, who was said to have liked its mild fresh flavour and to have also noted that its topping colours—green, white, and red—were those of the Italian flag.<br>

                 The popularity of pizza in the United States began with the Italian community in New York City, where the Neapolitan pizza had an early influence. The first pizzeria appeared in New York City about the turn of the 20th century. After World War II the pizza industry boomed. </b><br><br>

                    <b>Gol gappa (also known as pani puri) is a popular bite-size chaat consisting of a hollow, crispy-fried puffed ball that is filled with potato, chickpeas, onions, spices, and flavoured water, usually tamarind or mint, and popped into one's mouth whole.<br>

                    The elements required for making home made golgappa are - crispy puri, a stuffing of your choice (soaked boondi, boiled potatoes, chickpeas and moong or ragda) and pani (teekha phudina pani and sweet imli pani). There are many other versions of pani too like lehsun ka pani, jaljeera, hing jeera pani.<br>

                    The combination of different flavors and textures - crispy, soft, spicy, tangy, and sweet - is what makes Pani Puri so popular. It is also a very affordable snack and can be found in various parts of India, sold by street vendors and in restaurants.<br>

                    While pani puri, which is in the category of South Asian food known as chaat, is most commonly enjoyed as a tea-time snack, in my household it's eaten for breakfast<br><br><br><br>

                        Locho means something fishy actually there is a interesting story behind it that once a chef by mistake added more water to the khaman batter so it turned out little bit more softer and mashy than regular one so he yelled," arre aa to locho thai gayo" and to hide his mistake, he served that dish along with the tasty ...<br>

                        'Locho' in Gujarati actually means a mistake which explains why this dish is named so. The invention of Locho was actually a mistake but that mistake led to the creation of one of the most iconic dishes of Gujarat. Locho is best paired with fresh chopped onion, sev and mint chutney.<br><br><br>
